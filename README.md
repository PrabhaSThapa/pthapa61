👋👀 Hi all, I’m @pthapa61

👴 After many years of professional employment, I am now wetting my toes in learning computer science. 

😵 Why? You might wonder! Well, the simple fact is, once we get to a certain age, plus if you take a career break to look after your family can turn against you and you are silently struck off and you become unwanted. 
🌻So, not willing to give up and becoming rusty and fade away, I've taken the initiative to learning computer science, testing Python and soon after Kotlin but after a while, took up advises of super coders out there to learn Frontend Development (html, css and js) first. 

✨🌻 I am currently fully concentrating on html and css and taking in as much as I can and become confident in using them. Hopefully, some day soon, I will be in a position to collaborate with you brilliant people out there and become useful in some way.  

✨ So, until then...👍
